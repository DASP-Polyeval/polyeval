Port 5000 Conflict on macOS
--------------------------

On macOS, port 5000 is used by AirPlay Receiver by default. Since the backend server also uses port 5000, you may encounter a port conflict error when trying to start the backend server.

To resolve this issue, you can either:

1. Disable AirPlay Receiver:
   
   * Go to System Preferences/Settings
   * Click on "Sharing"
   * Uncheck "AirPlay Receiver"

Note: If you're using macOS Monterey (macOS 12) or later, AirPlay Receiver is enabled by default and uses port 5000.
