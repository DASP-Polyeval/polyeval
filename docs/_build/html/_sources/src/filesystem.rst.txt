File system
===========
The file system is a key component of the backend. It is responsible for storing and retrieving files from the database. The file system is implemented using the SQLAlchemy ORM and the Flask-Uploads extension.

The file system is used to store files that are uploaded by users. The files are stored in the database as binary data. The file system also provides a way to retrieve the files from the database and serve them to the user.
