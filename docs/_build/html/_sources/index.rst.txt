PolyEval documentation
======================
Introduction
----------------
Evaluating large language models, especially for low-resource languages, remains challenging due to fragmented benchmarks focused on high-resource languages. PolyEval addresses this by offering an Automatic Evaluation Toolkit, a suite of tools for standardized LLM performance assessment that supports custom evaluation pipelines across multiple tasks, benchmarks, and metrics, such as: 

Text Classification: SIB-200 and Taxi-1500.
Machine Translation: Flores200.
Summarization: XL-Sum
Open-ended Generation: Aya, PolyWrite
Machine Comprehension: BELEBELE, arc_multilingual
Intrinsic Evaluation: glot500, pbc

The results, products of this toolkit, will be displayed through a user-friendly interface, allowing for horizontal comparisons in charts and providing human evaluations.
